Assumptions and design choices:
We assumed that our servers are synchronized, and that 
ports 8000 and onward are available.
Our implementation allows for single-word strings for keys and values.
We chose to use UDP in this MP, because we thought it would be 
simpler.

We write our key-value pairs into a file for each replica.

Algorithms and Implementation:
We decided to use the "last writer wins" consistency repair rule.
As such, for each key-value pair, we stored a "last modified" timestamp. 
When a key-value pair gets deleted, we also record the timestamp of 
this operation. These timestamps represent the times when
the operation was requested, not when the replica receives and 
processes the message. The message includes this timestamp.

When a process receives an operation with the timestamp, it will 
acknowledge that the operation has ended with a message containing
the original requestor's timestamp, such that we ignore older ACKs.

The insert and update operations are extremely similar considering
we did not have to handle the situations where we are inserting
an already existing key, or updating a nonexistent key.
