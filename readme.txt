Usage:
python mp3.py <delays>


The number of values in <delays> should be the number of servers. We have 
implemented our system such that a server will send a message to itself with delay as well.

The config file name is hardcoded into the main script of mp3.py

If Level is set to any value other than 1, the code will default to ALL
consistency.
